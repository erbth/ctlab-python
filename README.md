Python bindings for c´t-lab

============================

This project contains some python bindings for the c´t-lab electronics
measuring- and controlling system. c´t-lab was developed by Carsten Mayer,
a reporter at the german IT magazine c´t. For details on c´t-lab see
www.ct-lab.de, but be aware c´t-lab is about to age already and I'm not sure
how long those sites will exist.

This project contains bindings for some of the so called 'modules' or rather a
subset of their functionality. Currently available are basic operations
(setting current, voltage and measure them) on ADA-IO and DCG.

Moreover a python class for analyzing bipolar transistor's characteristics
using ADA-IO with DA12 and AD16, DCG, and a resistor is included.

I may add more applications and bindings for modules if I need them.

Everyone is welcome to copy, modify and redistribute this code.
You can do whatever you like with it, however it comes with absolutely no
warranty and may not use good-practice-principles. Hence you shall not use
it for critical applications, such as - but not limited to ;-) - medical
applications.

You are also welcome to contribute if you like. Just submit a PR.
